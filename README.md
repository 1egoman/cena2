Cena, version 2
===

THis better version of cena (old version is <http://github.com/1egoman/cena>) has been rewritten from the ground up to work better, and to be less buggy.

Cena is an application designed to make grocery lists as easy as possible. Create a new list, and eith a few clicks easily add items to each list. Create special "recipe" lists that contain common recipes that you make daily. Share your lists with the world, or keep them private. If you try and print out a list, Cena will auto format the list to look its best.
