    Lists are the foundation of Cena v2 - Create a list for your shopping trip,
    or even for a recipe. Lists are recursive, ie lists can contain other lists.
  <p>

  <p>
    To add a recipe to Cena v2 create a new list (Lists -> Add new), and fill out the
    relevant info. Remember to tag new recipes symantically:
    <ul>
      <li>
        'grocery' defines a new grocery list. This should be used by convention so
        that grocery lists are searchable in the search box (it will look for this tag).
      </li>
      <li>
        'recipe' defines a new recipe. Lists with this tag are marked in the
        overall list view with a light blue header to help them stand out.
      </li>
      <li>
        'no-gluten' defines a gluten-free recipe. It will put a
        <span style="color: red;">[GF]</span> into the toolbar.
      </li>
      <li>
        'veg' defines a vegitarian meal. It will put a
        <span style="color: green;">[V]</span> into the toolbar.
      </li>
      <li>
        'maggie' defines a maggie-freindly meal. It will put a
        <span style="color: #F0F;">[MG]</span> into the toolbar.
      </li>
      <li>
        'ryan' defines a ryan-freindly meal. It will put a
        <span style="color: #71C837;">[RY]</span> into the toolbar.
      </li>
      <li>
        'bob' defines a bob-freindly meal. It will put a
        <span style="color: #36b8c7;">[B]</span> into the toolbar.
      </li>
    </ul>

    To sort lists into groups, tag them with tags that start with <code>sort-</code>. So, <code>sort-abc</code>
    gets matched with all other <code>sort-abc</code>s and not with other tags. Anything that doesn't
    provide a <code>sort-*</code> tag is put into the unsorted group.

    If you want any more tags, let me know. They are easy to add.
  </p>

  <p>
    To add anything into a list, type its name into the textbox above the list and
    click add. Remember, you can add lists to lists, so list names will also work here.
    If you add a list and you only want a few things from it, a list of all the components
    of the list will show up allowing you to delete some unneeded ingredients.
  </p>

  <p>
    Descriptions should be a short phrase describing the item.
